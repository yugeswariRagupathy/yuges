SECTION 1:

ANSWER FOR QUESTION NUMBER 1:

1. MTF 
	The modulation transfer function is a parameter to characterize the sharpness of the photographic imaging system or a componenet of a system 
and also measured image quality.It is also known as Spatial frequency response.
                                
						
						
						MTF = Image Modulation / Object Modulation


5. Sensor Selectivity and Sensitivity
				
	Sensor Selectivity :
			
		Selectivity of a sensor is to characterize the selectively a group of analytes or specifically to a single analyte(measure the specific
concentration of a substances in the presence of other substances).

	Sensor Sensitivity :
			
		Sensor Sensitivity = output signal / Measured property 


  EXAMPLE :
	    Sensitivity refers to the detector's ability to pick up all signals that are emitted from the body using ultrasound scanning.
	    Selectivity refers to the detector's ability to filter out unwanted signals that give only useful signals.
