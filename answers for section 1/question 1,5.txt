SECTION 1:

ANSWER FOR QUESTION NUMBER 1:

1. MTF 
	The modulation transfer function is a parameter to characterize the sharpness of the photographic imaging system or a componenet of a system and also measured image quality.It is also known as Spatial frequency response.
	 It is amagnitude of optical tansfer function
	 			
				OTP = |OTP|e^iPTF = MTF e^iPTF
				
         MTF use properties of fourier transform to provide more general describtion of the image properties of an optical system.
	
						MTF = Actual Image Modulation / Ideam image Modulation
						
5. Sensor Selectivity and Sensitivity
				
	Sensor Selectivity :
			
		Selectivity of a sensor is to characterize the selectively a group of analytes or specifically to a single analyte(measure the specific
concentration of a substances in the presence of other substances).

	Sensor Sensitivity :
			
		Sensor Sensitivity = output signal / Measured property 


  EXAMPLE :
	    Sensitivity refers to the detector's ability to pick up all signals that are emitted from the body using ultrasound scanning.
	    Selectivity refers to the detector's ability to filter out unwanted signals that give only useful signals.
