SECTION 3:


1.HYPOTHESIS TESTING 
	
	It is a statistical test to determine whether our assumption of hypothesis for sample of data stands true for the whole population or not .This test simply 
determines the relationship between two sets of samples. 


	TYPES:
	
	    1.Simple Hypothesis
            2.Complex Hypothesis
            3.Emprical Hypothesis
	    4.Null Hypothesis
            5.Alternative Hypothesis
            6.Logical Hypothesis
            7.Statistical Hypothesis

		Above testings are used in statistical solutions,business and real life


2.CORRELATION

 DEFINITION :
	
	It is the process of establishing a relationship or connection between two or more things that are very together over a period of time. 
		
	Types of correlation :

            1.positive correlation 
			
   			It exists when high values of one variable associate with high values of another variables.
	   
	    2.Negative Correlation

			It exists when high values of one variable associate with low values of another variables.

	    3.Zero Correlation 

			It has no correlation between two variables.

	Correlation can vary from +1 to -1 :      

		+1 indicate that high degree of positive correlation.
		-1 indicate that high degree of negative correlation.

	a.Various methods of computing

		1.Scatter diagram methods
		2.Karl pearson's co-efficient of correlation
		3.Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
		4.Methods of Least squares

	b.Applications of correlations in biomedical engineering and technology, 

		1. Application of cross corrrelation method in cardiac output measurement.
		2.Using correlation coefficients in ECG waveform for arrhythmia detection.  

	c.P value 
		
		The p value is a level marginal significance within statistical hypothesis test representing the probability of occurance of a particular event.

						p = r / square root of (r^2) * (N-2)



3. For Example, during an expedition to the deserts of Western Australia n=23 marsupial moles were weighted (Look table below)

                                          Weight in g      45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52
                                          Number of Moles  2   1  3  5  4 2  4  2

          a. Determine the sample mean, variance and the standard deviation from the frequency table

		SOLUTION:
			
	          MEAN

				Mean =  summation of x * F  /  summation of F  or n                                           [summation of F = n]
			
				x => weight in g
                                F => Number of moles

                                  Mean (Bar x) = 45*2 + 46*1 + 47*3 + 48*5 + 49*4 + 50*2 + 51*4 + 52*2  / 23
			
			                       = 1121 / 23
				
			                       = 48.7391304 
			
		 VARIANCE 

				sigma = summation of (x - bar x) * F / summation of F or n 

				
		    TABLE :
 				
			S.NO		X		F		X*F		X - bar X		(X - bar X)^2		(X _ bar X)^2 * F

				TOTAL			23		1121								1656.521704	



				sigma = 1656.521704 / 23
					
				      = 72.02268279


		STANDARD DEVIATION 

			
				S = square root of (variance)
 							
				  = square root of (72.02268279)

				  = 8.486617865
